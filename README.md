# Search-Field-With-PHP
Using mysql database I made a blog and there I add a search field using PHP.
It is a simple blog, I inserted the records into the databse. For searching purpose I add a search field on top of the page.
Users can search for a particular blog using this search blog.

The best thing about this blog is,users can literally search with any character( date, day,name, title etc.)
It will show how many results are there after finishing the searching, from there we can find our desired result.
